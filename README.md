# GPT-Based-Smart-Assistant
This project is an interactive, voice-controlled assistant powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT model. Designed to enable natural and intelligent conversations, the assistant uses advanced speech recognition for voice input and text-to-speech synthesis for spoken responses. It provides a hands-free, intuitive user experience ideal for personal productivity and AI interaction experiments.

## Key Features
-Natural Language Understanding: Leverages GPT-based NLP for intelligent and contextual responses.
-Speech-to-Text Conversion: Converts user voice input into text using reliable speech recognition tools.
-Text-to-Speech Integration: Converts AI-generated text responses back into speech for natural conversation flow.
-Modular Design: Built with Python and integrated APIs for speech processing and AI interaction.
-Customizable: Easily extend or adapt for specific use-cases or platforms.

## Technologies Used
-Python
-OpenAI GPT (via API)
-SpeechRecognition
-pyttsx3 / gTTS (for Text-to-Speech)
-Other supporting libraries (as per implementation)
